## 什么是宏

* 书名是『宏』，它被作者展开为这本书的全部内容。
* 药瓶上的标签是『宏』，将药片从瓶中倾倒出来，就是这个宏的展开结果。
* 被用的最多的『宏』，应该是 Internet 的超级链接。
* 每当你点击一个超级链接，就相当于将这个宏展开为网页中的内容。
* 生活中，类似的例子还有很多，只要你给某种具体的事物贴上了一个标签，那么这个标签就相当于宏。

## m4简介

```
GNU M4 is an implementation of the traditional Unix macro processor.
It is mostly SVR4 compatible although it has some extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters to macros).
GNU M4 also has built-in functions for including files, running shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc.

GNU M4 is a macro processor in the sense that it copies its input to the output expanding macros as it goes.
Macros are either builtin or user-defined and can take any number of arguments.
Besides just doing macro expansion, m4 has builtin functions for including named files, running UNIX commands, doing integer arithmetic, manipulating text in various ways, recursion etc... m4 can be used either as a front-end to a compiler or as a macro processor in its own right.

One of the biggest users of GNU M4 is the GNU Autoconf project.
